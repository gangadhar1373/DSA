# Linked List
A Linked list is a linear data structure where elements(nodes) are stored in a sequence but not in a contiguous memory (single continuous block if memory) location like an array. Each node in a linked list contains two parts:
1. Data -  The actual value stored in the node.
2. Next - A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list.

## Types of linked list

1. Singly linked list - Each node points to the next node.
2. Doubly Linked List - Each node has reference to both the next and previous node.
3. Circular Linked list - The last node points back to the first node, making the list circular.
